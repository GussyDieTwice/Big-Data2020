# Test Project

## Introduction.
Machine learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than learn through explicit programming.
As the algorithm ingests training data, it is possible to produce more accurate models based on data. 
A machine learning model is the information output that is generated when you train your machine learning algorithm with data. 
After training, providing a model with an input will give it an output [1].

abstract- In this project and research we will make a comparison with different Machine Learning 
techniques such as SVM, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Perceptron, making use of
the same csv called calle bank with approximately 40,000 records.

## ALGORITHMS
## Multilayer Perceptron

Multilayer perceptron classifier. The multilayer perceptron classifier (MLPC) is a classifier based on the
feedforward artificial neural network. MLPC consists of multiple layers of nodes. Each layer is completely connected to the next layer in the network. 
The nodes in the input layer represent the input data. All other nodes map inputs to outputs performing a linear combination of the inputs with the node 
weights and bias and applying a trigger function.

As described in the Image, MLPC consists of multiple layers of nodes, including the input layer, hidden layers (also called middle layers), and output layers. 
Each layer is completely connected to the next layer in the network. Where the input layer, the intermediate layers and the output layer can be defined as follows:

* The input layer is the neurons that accept the input values, the nodes are those that represent the input data.
* The hidden layers are found between the input and output layers and their function depends on those assigned by the input layer to the output layer of a node.
* The output layer is the final layer of a neural network that returns the result to the user's environment.



A multilayer perceptron has three distinctive characteristics:

1. The model of each neuron in the network includes a non-linearity in the final output. The important point to emphasize here is that nonlinearity 
is smooth (that is, differentiable). A commonly used way for nonlinearity to satisfy this requirement is to use a sigmoidal nonlinearity defined by the following function:

where yj is the output of neuron, and vj is the internal activity level of neuron j. The presence of non-linearities is important because otherwise the 
input-output relationship of the lattice could be reduced to that of a single-layer perceptron. Furthermore, the use of the function described in has biological motivations.

2. The network contains one or more hidden layers that are not part of the input or output of the network. These hidden layers activate
the network to learn complex tasks by extracting more meaningful features from the input patterns.

3. The network exhibits a high degree of connectivity, determined by the synapses of the network. A
The change in network connectivity requires a change in the synaptic connections or their weights [2].

## Decision tree

A decision tree is a schematic representation that facilitates decision-making by visually representing the different possibilities that exist in a scenario, 
as well as the possible consequences that each scenario could bring. Its name is given due to the similarity that the scheme has with the branches of a tree;
In addition, a decision tree can be used in any aspect of daily life, from difficult decisions in the family, to complex applications in business and artificial intelligence.

Decision trees are especially useful when:
* The alternatives or courses of action are well defined (for example: accept or reject a proposal, increase production capacity or not, build or not a new warehouse, etc.)
* The uncertainties can be quantified (for example: probability of success of an advertising campaign, probable effect on sales, probability of passing stages, etc.)
* The objectives are clear (for example: increase sales, maximize profits, minimize costs, etc.) [3].
